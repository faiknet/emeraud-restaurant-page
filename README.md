## Challenges and Takeaways 
Creating this project was challenging, but also exciting because it allowed me to enhance my skills in React and CSS. The biggest challenges I faced were figuring out how to solve various use cases in React and improving the design using CSS. However, through trial and error, research, and guidance from more experienced developers, I was able to come up with effective solutions. Despite the difficulties, I found the process to be incredibly rewarding, as I learned the importance of perseverance, seeking feedback, and the satisfaction of overcoming challenges to produce something valuable.
